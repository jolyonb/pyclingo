# PyClingo and ASPuzzle

Copyright Jolyon Bloomfield 2025

This repository houses a pair of libraries:
* `pyclingo` is a python wrapper around clingo that generates clingo scripts in an ORM fashion
* `aspuzzle` is a framework for defining the rules of logic puzzles in clingo, leveraging `pyclingo` for the interface

Together, these make for a powerful declarative manner of solving logic puzzles.
