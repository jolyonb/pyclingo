# Cave Rules

Cave puzzles (also known as BAG or Corral) consist of a rectangular grid with numbered cells.

The objective is to shade some cells of the grid to create walls around a cave according to the following rules:

1. Shaded cells represent walls, unshaded cells represent the cave.
2. All unshaded cave cells must form a single connected group (the cave).
3. All shaded wall cells must be connected to the edge of the grid (no enclosed walls).
4. All numbered cells must be part of the cave (unshaded).
5. Each number indicates the total count of cave cells that can be seen from that cell horizontally and vertically, including the cell itself. "Seeing" means being in a direct line of sight, not blocked by any walls.

## Variations

* Cave puzzles can be played on non-rectangular grids.
