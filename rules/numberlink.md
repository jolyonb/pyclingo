# Numberlink Rules

Numberlink (also known as Flow Free, Nanbarinku, or Arukone) is a logic puzzle played on a rectangular grid with numbered endpoints.

The objective is to connect pairs of identical numbers with non-intersecting paths according to the following rules:

1. Each numbered cell is an endpoint that must be connected to exactly one other cell with the same number.
2. Paths are drawn through cells (horizontally and vertically, not diagonally).
3. Each path connects exactly two endpoints with the same number.
4. Paths cannot cross or overlap each other.
5. Every cell in the grid must be part of exactly one path.
6. Paths cannot branch - each non-endpoint cell must have exactly two path connections (forming a continuous line), while endpoint cells have exactly one path connection.
7. Paths cannot touch themselves orthogonally.

## Variations

* Some variations allow paths to be drawn on triangular or hexagonal grids.
