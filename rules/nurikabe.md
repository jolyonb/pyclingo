# Nurikabe Rules

Nurikabe (also called "Islands in the Stream") is a binary determination puzzle played on a rectangular grid. 

The objective is to fill in cells according to the following rules:

1. Cells are either filled (black/wall) or unfilled (white/island).
2. Numbered cells indicate "island" sizes and must remain unfilled (white).
3. Each island must contain exactly one numbered cell, and the number indicates the total number of white cells in that island.
4. All white cells forming an island must be connected horizontally or vertically (they must form a single contiguous group).
5. All black cells must be connected horizontally or vertically to form a single "stream" or "wall".
6. Black cells cannot form a 2Ã—2 square or larger anywhere on the grid.

## Variations

* Nurikabe can be played on non-rectangular grids.
