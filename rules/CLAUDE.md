# rules/

This directory contains rule documentation for logic puzzles implemented in the aspuzzle framework. Each markdown file provides human-readable explanations of puzzle rules, variations, and links to online puzzle sites.

## Purpose

- **Reference Documentation** - Clear explanations of how each puzzle type works
- **Implementation Guide** - Canonical rules that can be translated into ASP constraints
- **Educational Resource** - Accessible explanations for users unfamiliar with puzzle types

## File Format

Each rule file follows a consistent structure:

1. **Title and Description** - Brief overview of the puzzle type and objective
2. **Rules Section** - Numbered list of core constraints and requirements
3. **Variations Section** - Common modifications and extensions
4. **External Links** - URLs to online puzzle generators and examples

The rules are written as concrete constraints that can be directly mapped to solver implementations, focusing on what must be enforced rather than solving strategies.
