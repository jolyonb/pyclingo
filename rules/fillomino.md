# Fillomino Rules

Fillomino (also known as "Polyominous") is a logic puzzle played on a rectangular grid with some numbered cells.

The objective is to divide the entire grid into blocks (polyominoes) according to the following rules:

1. Each cell must contain a positive integer.
2. The grid must be divided into blocks (polyominoes) such that each block contains only one number value repeated throughout.
3. Each block must contain exactly as many cells as the number in that block. For example, a block containing the number 3 must consist of exactly 3 cells.
4. Blocks of the same size cannot share an edge (they cannot touch horizontally or vertically, but may touch diagonally).

## Variations

* Some variations may have blocks that can wrap around the edges of the grid.
* Fillmonio can be played on a non-rectangular grid.
