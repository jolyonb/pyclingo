# Stitches

Stitches puzzles are played on a rectangular grid that is divided into regions.

The aim is to place stitches in adjacent cells such that:
 
* Each region is connected to all its neighbor regions with exactly 1 "stitch" each (or more for higher stitch ratings).
* A "stitch" connects 2 orthogonally adjacent cells from different regions.
* Different stitches cannot share a hole.
* The clues outside the grid indicate the number of holes on that row/column.

## Variations

* Stitches puzzles work equally well on non-rectangular grids.
