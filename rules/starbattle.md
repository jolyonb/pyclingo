# Star Battle

Star Battle puzzles are played on an NxN square grid that has been divided into N regions. Each grid also has a star rating (usually 1-3 stars, with smaller grids having smaller ratings).

The aim is to place a number of stars equal to the star rating in each row, column and region, subject to the following condition:
 
* Stars cannot be placed adjacent to each other (including diagonally).

## Variations

* A "shapeless" variation is still played on a square grid, but has no regions defined. Instead, some cells are blacked out and cannot have a star placed on them. The goal is to place the star rating number of stars on each row and column, still subject to the adjacency constraint.
* Star Battle puzzles are sometimes played on non-square grids, but the column/row constraints may be written differently in such a situation.
