# Slitherlink Rules

Slitherlink puzzles (also called fences, loop the loop, or loop puzzles) consist of a dotted grid with numbers between the gridpoints.

The puzzle is to draw vertical/horizontal lines between dots to create a single loop across the grid that doesn't cross or branch. The numbers indicate how many loop segments are on the edge of that square.

## Variations

* Sometimes there are sheep (or similar animals) in the grid; these are intended to be included inside the fenced region. It's also possible to have wolves (or similar threats) that need to be excluded from the fenced region.
* Slitherlink puzzles work equally well on non-square grids.
